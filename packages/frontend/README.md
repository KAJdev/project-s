This is the frontend for Project S. For the most part its just like any old nextjs project, but I have added my own spices. Take a look at [this globals file](src/globals.ts) for the sauce.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You're done hopefully. It's frontend. It's all the same.
